| Setting | Function |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Active Avatar | The Avatar you want to convert an override for. |

Common Questions
--------------
**Can I use this to replace Animations within my own Animators?**
>No, I may release another tool later on for that. This is meant simply for upgrading 2.0 Avatars in an easier fashion so you can get on to learning and trying new things.

Troubleshooting
--------------
**The window refuses to open.**
>To fix this, reset your Editor layout by clicking Layout in the top right of the Editor and clicking Reset Factory Settings, then attempt to open the window again.

**"An exception occured!"**
>If this happens, ensure you have a clean install of AV3 Overrides, and if the problem persists, [let me know](#contacting-me)!
